       " '\"Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don\\'t answer the questions beyond thatWell, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with \"\"probabilities\"\". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don\\'t understand it, you can\\'t do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn\\'t have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say \"\"well, it\\'s so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it\"\". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don\\'t understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that\\'s all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, \"\"B\"\" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if \"\"A\"\" were a dead body and \"\"B\"\" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that\\'s what killed him. You don\\'t have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, \"\"A\"\", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you\\'ve never actually observed \"\"B\"\". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn\\'t science.  \"',\n",

       " 'Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.The major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been so000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.',\n",

The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.The Present Witzeman is 1-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.                           HistoryThe present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being 1th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.                       Proper HistoryAs early as t4th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to tst Witzeman Rebellion 555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the ear900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in t980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion 988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. 990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.\",\n",

LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (t0th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). ) By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. T990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)5\",\n",

       " '\"== Attributing and classifying of personalities == Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately frth decade of t0th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don\\'t pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).  period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, appr930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

I do not want that happenning.Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided?. Thank you.  Randroide answers to New reference by Bur0   At last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: The false \"\"suicidal\"\" terrorists from PRISA will also be included there. Come oooooon, boys, start writing that section. I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me. But remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources. Just like me citing \"\"El País\"\" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of t3th bomb. Cheers   Indeed, a good point. And all the remarks in COPE too. And the \"\"moral certitudes\"\" of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo.  I agree with y00%, Larean.  What Randroide omits to mention on the section about t3th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not.   You are right, Southofwatford, in your \"\"Randroide omits...\"\" section.If you have not subscription to \"\"El País\"\", I am sorry but that´s your problem. My \"\"institutional\"\" access also has some advantages, like paid access to \"\"El País\"\" (and many, many other publications and books). That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of \"\"filtered\"\" Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.Do you see?. The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources.BTW, if you write under a \"\"Randroide answers\"\" section you are:Invading \"\"my\"\" space. I do not mind, really. But you are doing it.Risking new truncations on your messages. To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE \"\"Randroide answers\"\" sections.If you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV. The article is not \"\"mine\"\".  I\\'ll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it\\'s very short. The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País, its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it. All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is, to my mind, completely unreasonable.  All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the articleVery funny, Southofwatford. I am going to follow this joke of yours.Please propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book.Delete all references to TV or radio stations, because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home.Delete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish.It´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. I had a good laugh.User:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it\\'s simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response.',\n",

I'm concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal.  If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, it's not the first time.  Look at Issei Sagawa.  Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted, and that guilty people will be acquited, from time to time.  That's the price you pay for having a legal system; in the end someone has to make the decision, and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right.

       " '\"0\\'s rantPresently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as \"\"primitive\"\" and \"\"rural\"\" (even \"\"fashist\"\") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, \"\"performed\"\" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this yea004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition. Another \"\"apostle\"\" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as \"\"gusle players\"\". Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović\\'s book \"\"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje\"568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovni547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, M, 2). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatovi816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry.  Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Mioši8th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić\\'s work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudri) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trli).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn\\'t play gusle (it\\'s    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in t960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanov969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade 0th century  states in her book  \"\"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West\"\" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe 4)This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in t930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, )Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock \\'n\\' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre',\n",

But the final debate  October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, 73.  \"',\n",

       " 'In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims. It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and ist century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. They are free to do this, but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.',\n",

       " '\":::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets. Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech.  To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn\\'t have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas.  Saying that DLA has \"\" h9 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China, ...\"\" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like \"\"in major financial centres\"\" or \"\"in major commercial centres\"\" or \"\"in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres\"\" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research. I do accept that DLA, wi9 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.  \"',\n",

He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn\\'t even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN\\'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising abo/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I\\'ll tell you why: the user wasn\\'t engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I\\'d guess it\\'s some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don\\'t really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn\\'t directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn\\'t do what he/she did, but I\\'m wasting my own time here and I don\\'t really have a stake in any such pretense. I don\\'t have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don\\'t see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn\\'t me here, it\\'s that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don\\'t recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn\\'t quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it\\'s having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won\\'t egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English.

       " '\" Question on Possible Citation I\\'m sorry if I missed your question - I don\\'t pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven\\'t yet worked in \"\"no original research\"\".) WP:NOR says that we mustn\\'t integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don\\'t arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. Getting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I\\'m not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. Overall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects \"\"warts and all\"\" we shouldn\\'t enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. - \"\"but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources.\"\" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn\\'t clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don\\'t see how that can be objective.  Bauer I\\'m sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al., but I\\'ve been somewhat overloaded at work. Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn\\'t seem like a lynch mob. Y\\'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted .

       " '\" Philosopher RFC philosopher (from Wiktionary): A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a \"\"philosopher\"\" (without qualifiers) in the lead.  This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy, only that it is his career. (Note: Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present. The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that \"\"philosopher\"\" is accurate and widely accepted, then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place.) Definitions Obviously, each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. Some will call him explicitly a \"\"philosopher\"\" or has views on \"\"philosophy\"\", but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. Using one word \"\"philosopher\"\" in the lead sentence covers all of his political, ethical, and theistic specializations in one word, which we then elaborate on later in the article. \"\"philosophical conversation\"\", \"\"philosophy show\"\" - used to describe his Freedomain Radio series \"\"libertarian\"\", \"\"libertarian thinker\"\" - \"\"Libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ...\"\" \"\"anarcho-capitalist\"\" - \"\"Anarcho-capitalism ... is a political philosophy...\"\" \"\"voluntaryist\"\" - \"\"Voluntaryism (or sometimes voluntarism), is a libertarian philosophy...\"\" \"\"athiest\"\" - \"\"Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches.\"\" \"\"ethics- \"\"Ethics, sometimes known as philosophical ethics, ethical theory, moral theory, and moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy\"\" \"\"Secular ethics- \"\"Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy...\"\" Primary source As Stefan Molyneux is a living person, we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him (obviously, we don\\'t want to host any sort of \"\"fringe\"\" claims). If we are to dispute what he says about himself, though, then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this, or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability - this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place. I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct.

       " '\" stradbroke galleon / portuguese hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more th00 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by \"\"mainstream\"\" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the \"\"mainstream\"\" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian\\'s mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian\\'s antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails.    \"',\n",

Until Nintendo decided to go with an Italian accent, fans assumed the TV show (and later the movie) accent was the official standing.

I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors \"\"get it wrong\"\" is that they believe Wikipedia\\'s job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia\\'s job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.Instead of \"\"truth\"\", Wikipedia aims for \"\"verifiability\"\".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents \"\"THE TRUTH\"\" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.I have been trying to hit this NPOV \"\"sweet spot\"\" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides. Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don\\'t want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that\\'s not discussion about the NPOV edits.

       " '\"I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: \"\"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who \"\"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth\"\" but this was dismissed as \"\"speculative opinion\"\" by riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  \"',\n",

That was like tnd day almost two months ago.All of my references are verifiable.There\\'s nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation.  I didn\\'t put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge.I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article. I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view.  Those references were deleted by someone, I can\\'t remember who and don\\'t know why. At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript.  The guy who runs the blog isrd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers.   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for. I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.I don\\'t believe that I did any original research. All I did is search the Internet for references for the article.  I really didn\\'t know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article. I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back 004.  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst.I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway.  Same as the U.N. covenantcan\\'t really hide that.   I didn\\'t add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously. Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that tth Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words \"\"pro se\"\" in t0s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).  What I found in t0s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly.I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is \"\"soap boxing\"\". I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. I\\'ve been an entrepreneur. I didn\\'t know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article. That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article. The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article.Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself.  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven\\'t got it yet. But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state. Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states. The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think. So did the history of workmen\\'s comp, which is of course related to unions.  \"',\n",

You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you\\'d think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation\"\"According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa\\'d ibn Mua\\'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: \"\"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.\"\" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba\\'s gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.\"\"This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it\\'s a fact?There are articles for \"\"Criticisms of Islam\"\" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate \"\"criticisms of Islam\"\" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.Good day.  Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where \"\"treason\"\" or \"\"traitor\"\" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.

Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn\\'t serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.While your first version was needlessly verbose (\"\"it is to be noted that\"\"), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt.

Hurmata objects to QuizzicalBee\\'s sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed Chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from Chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. QB objects, saying that maybe in t960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited.

It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.We want a function f satisfying)=e and f)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that and present no problems:)=1 and )=0.To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of leng, such a,1).And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable o,1), or equivalently on,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interva,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f) we get f '(x) = f ')/f). Hence f )=f))=f), so f ' must be constant o,1]! Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative betwee a.\",\n",

Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya h% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians.

For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... questi: Why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I\\'m just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of \"\"ebaY\"\" logo to go next to the current one, \"\"ebay,\"\" in the lead, is \"\"because I wanted it in there,\"\" even though that is a total lie; but it\\'s supposedly \"\"not okay\"\" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?3. Here\\'s another one: Why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" for him and \"\"smiley girl\"\" there to falsely accuse my edits of being \"\"vandalism\"\" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a \"\"personal attack\"\" just because I\\'m an IP-only editor?4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with \"\"Oh, you can\\'t do that \\'cause that\\'s a \\'personal attack\\',\"\" or \"\"Oh, that\\'s bad because that\\'s \\'harassment\\' \"\"?5. Oh yeah, here\\'s one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn\\'t even have to be breakiRR) that says that \"\" \\'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring\\' is no defense\"\"? Well then doesn\\'t that apply to meeting some so-called \"\"consensus\"\" too (since some things aren\\'t cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called \"\"consensus\"\" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) \"\"consensus\"\" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who\\'s against your exclusive \"\"consensus,\"\" do the same thing, it\\'s \"\"edit-warring\"\" even though it was the same thing as what smiley\\'s doing (remember the \"\"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense\"\" rule)?1  \"',\n",

However, the Hague has stated that the majority of these aren\\'t considered \"\"victims\"\" (as they were portrayed by the Serbian media) because among the000 are a large number of military police officers and Serbian soldiers killed in combat with Bosnian troops.

Since the anniversary is tomorrow do you think there is some way that the article could be temporarily protected for a day to prevent last minute POV vandalism? List of functions Hi Jitse. I\\'ve replied to your question about List of mathematical functions on my talk page. , Ju (UTC) Jitse Niesen has made a logical fallacy I would like to remind Jitse Niesen who claimed the facts below that he has made a logical falacy called \"\"Appeal To Widespread Belief\"\" http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#bandwagonFor example, in t800\\'s there was a widespread belief that bloodletting cured sickness. Now we know it to be wrong. Thus, whether it be institutions such as NATO, the Red Sross, or individuals, their mere opinions about an issue cary little force when it comes to making a logical argument. In fact, the use of this falacy in an argument renders the arguemnt invalid; the author who uses Appeal To Widespread Belief is never taken seriously.  Jitse Niesen wrote:\"\"I don\\'t think dividing the sites in \"\"supporting genocide theses\"\" and \"\"opposing genocide theses\"\" is helpful. What you call the Bosnian/NATO point of view, is in fact also the point of view of the UN (including the ICTY), Japan, Indonesia, Red Cross, and pretty much the whole world.\"\"(preceding unsigned comment  Ju005)I agree that it is indeed a logical fallacy to conclude the truth of some statement from the fact that most (or even everybody) think it is true. However, I don\\'t see where I have committed this mistake. In the second sentence of the fragment quoted to above, I say that the \"\"Bosnian/NATO point of view\"\" is far more widespread than the Serbian one, which implies that it should get more attention since \"\"[i]f we are to represent the dispute fairly, we should present competing views in proportion to their representation among experts on the subject, or among the concerned parties\"\" (quoting from WP:NPOV). What I do believe to be the case, though I am not saying above, is that widespread belief strongly suggests truth.     The Truth Jitse Niesen wrote:\"\"Do you have specific suggestions on how we can improve the article?\"\"Yes I do. I\\'ll send you some articles on that topic when I have time, because I\\'m occupied preparing for some exams right now. Also you may take a look at www.ogrish.com, it you have membership credentials. I have some video materials too, showing the torture and death of Serbian civilians but have no way how to send you, but what I can do is to gather, or to write, something on Serbian history and culture that may change views because Serbs are often considered as \"\"occupators\"\" of the Bosnia, but the fact is that they are natives there and the \"\"Bosniaks\"\" are not a nation as they try to represent themselves today. They are merely Serb or Croats converted to Islam during the period of Ottoman Empire reign on the Balkan. Their language is Serbian. But as I said, the picture we have today is a result of politics and lobbying. The same thing is with Kosovo today.(preceding unsigned comment by Theodosi Ju',\n",

Pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism.  I dont know Phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more non-sex tourists so if I were going to identify a place in Thailand if not the world I would mention Pattaya instead and I am tempted to edit.  I hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more \"\"sex for money\"\" going on in Pattaya than Phuket. But for someone considering the phrase \"\"sex tourism\"\" as not necessarily pejorative I have to qualify this conclusion.  Note that \"\"bar girls\"\" in Thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general Thai population also.  Although I beleive that there are words in Thai for prostitute they mostly (at least the girls) prefer to call themselves \"\"rented wifes\"\" albeit for \"\"short time\"\" rather then \"\"long time\"\".  I therefore need to be qualify my Pattaya versus Phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and  rented wifes particularly of the \"\"long-term\"\" married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the \"\"wifes\"\" direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both.  There is no such thing as a free lunch and \"\"everybody pays for it\"\". [Note that I neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist (note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing) and moreover consider them culturally aware (particurlay Thailand wise).  The fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones! One must be aware that labels, concepts, ideas such as \"\"sex tourism\"\" carry suggestions associated with Religion particularly Judeo-Christiam-Islamic (JDI) pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the (Religious) worlds worldviews outside of some tribal, village, usually Buddhist and what I like to call \"\"Giesha cultures\"\": e.g. Japan, Thailand etc, versus \"\"Virgin cultures\"\" typically (JDI) that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. (Note that Thai Society is strangely contradictory in this regard  aren\\'t we all!  but then Thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west.)  Perhaps some historio-religious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also.  I hate value laden western (and Religious) labels that dress themselves up psuedo-scientificly as culturally universal.

Comments on Mediation added comments at [ Mediation Cabal#Comments from an outsider-Steven McCrary]  Major Restructuring Major resturcturing of this article was long overdue.  The article was almost entirely one long, long section, ironically called \"\"Overview\"\".  I completely restructured this article to be more in line with the common Wikipedia structure used for other television programs.  Most notably The Simpsons and M*A*S*H (TV series) were used as examples of shows that were very popular and well organized.  I attempted to use logic in the categries and their order.  This reorganization was definitely needed, but it meant a lot of the content had to be moved around but I did not remove any content (yet) (except for correcting the episode of The Danny Thomas Show as being the pilot.  It was the basis for the a new show, possibly categoried as a spin-off, but it wasn\\'t a pilot episode of TAGS).  I added some new content but I did not remove existing content because I figured this restructuring was such a major change that I figured to take one step at a time.   Please note that I did not move everything.  All content that was not moved (most of it) was left where it was but the section was renamed \"\"Commentary\"\".  I did not want to change too much all at once.  Much of that content is indeed commentary (not strictly factual) but some of it is still needs to be moved to more appropriate sections or deleted if duplicate information. Thanks for the hard work.  I wanted to work on this some time ago, but because of the situation recounted above that went to the Mediation Cabal and the \"\"truce\"\" proposed I have been reluctant to make any changes here.  Nice to see others are of the same mind.   Yeah, it looks a lot better.  Just prior to its restructuring, I added a bunch of stuff to fill out the article, because it seemed a little light (for as popular a show as it is), and also simply because the Sheriff Andy Taylor link redirects here, but there was very little content about the character on this page.  But I didn\\'t know where to put anything, so I just kind of stuck stuff here and there.  I hope I didn\\'t add any duplicate information. Please feel free to move it around or take it out if it isn\\'t necessary.   New (Big) Problem re: Episodes List The list of Andy Griffith episodes was apparently started in Octob005.  Many different people have worked hard on it, and it has always been the only episodes list linked to from The Andy Griffith Show.As I was revising the structure of The Andy Griffith Show (see above) I noticed that the list of episodes was actually misnamed.  It is, and has always been, located at List of Andy Griffith Show episodes.  Please notice that the mistake is that the word \"\"The\"\" was missing from the title (The name of the show is \"\"The Andy Griffith Show\"\").  Noticing this I decided correct the problem by moving the article to include the word \"\"The\"\" in the title, and I later planned on correcting the link on the main show\\'s article.  However when I tried this I was surprised to discover that I couldn\\'t do that because another article was already named List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes (with the \"\"The).Through dumb luck (or bad luck) I discovered that another user had started creating an list of Andy Griffith episode on their own, under their username where nobody else knew it existed.  This article was started after the original and was basically hidden from others.  Just this month the user that created the alternate episodes list moved their article to List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes, although the main show\\'s article still doesn\\'t point to it.So there\\'s the situation.  We\\'ve got two lists of episodes.  What to do?  Pros and Cons while staying neutral:  The original list is mistitled but has always been the only list linked to from the main article at The Andy Griffith Show.  Because it was always public more different people have worked on it.  The newer article is almost as old but it was \"\"hidden\"\" in a user area until just this month.  I will admit that the newer article looks nicer in style, structure, colors, etc. but IMHO I think the descriptions are better in the older, public list,',\n",

       " \"Britain's strategy of turning Germany eastwards to destroy USSRHey, I want to add in the view that Chamberlain's strategy was to turn Germany eastwards to destroy USSR. That view seems to be missing here. ...And by this date, certain members of the Milner Group and of the British Conservative government had reached the fantastic idea that they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia against one another in Eastern Europe.In this way they felt that the two enemies would stalemate one another, or that Germany would become satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the wheat of the Ukraine.It never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and Russia might make common cause, even temporarily, against the West.  Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus open all Central Europe to Bolshevism.This idea of bringing Germany into a collision with Russia was not to be found, so far as the evidence shows, among any members of the inner circle of the Milner Group.Rather it was to be found among the personal associates of Neville Chamberlain, including several members of the second circle of the Milner Group.  The two policies followed parallel courses until Mar939.  After that date the Milner Group’s disintegration became very evident, and part of it took the form of the movement of several persons (like Hoare and Simon) from the second circle of the Milner Group to the inner circle of the new group rotating around Chamberlain...''http://yamaguchy.netfirms.com/cikkek/ang2b.html\",\n",

In order to achieve a NPOV we have already removed two paragraphs on the apparent relevance of various other sonnets to the theory, and this one is far less appropriate than most of those which were deleted at that time. 2) The graph showing the time spans of various authorship candidates is relevant to the article on the Shakespeare authorship question as a whole, but in my opinion adds little of value to this article, the thrust of which is to explain the reasons why Marlovians believe that Marlowe surviv593 and made a major contribution to Shakespeare\\'s works, and not why anyone else did not. 3) The opening paragraph of the \"\"External Evidence\"\" section up to \"\"Shakespeare\\'s grave etc.\"\" was written as a counter to the argument of whole \"\"Marlowe\\'s Death\"\" section.

I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: \"\"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who \"\"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth\"\" but this was dismissed as \"\"speculative opinion\"\" by riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment).

I feel bad for them, they must have been nursing their grudges for long. LOL.Your message in my support and other messages have been deviously deleted by one of the cabal. LOL.Would you be bothered enough to put it in place again?The cabal obviously want to paint the issue their way. HAHAHAHAHA.I did not read a single message on my usertalk page after your nice supportive message because I already knew it must be full of the cabal's unmentionable things. LOL. I only noted the names of the cabal and had a big laugh.A few things did come out of the incident.Crossmr meekly submitted that he had not blocked me.He further admitted in so many of his own words that he had not even read the message Vesther had sent me to which I had replied, and that he had no idea about the issue, but he still sent  warning a message, LOL. Even after warning me and sending me another message, he did not have any idea about the issue and had not read about the issue at all!!! LOL.He further did not even warn Vesther, but he warned me for using those words, Vesthers words, which I only used to reply to him in his own medicine.!!! LOL.So, the result is that Crossmr has succeeded in showing himself to be UNFAIR, BIASED and grossly INCOMPETENT to be an admin. Who makes these guys admins??? LOL.As for Mr. Royboy, LOL. The less said about him the better. LOL. HAHAHAHAHA.Who made this guy admin? Where did he come from? Who IS he?What explanation did he give for blocking AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME?Me and Crossmr were just talking about his warning, which u know by now was totally wrong and biased, he was not even aware of the issue and gave an excuse of tralala, which Vesther had used!!!, and this guy turns up from nowhere?It was a total and absolute DISGRACEFUL abuse of admin priveleges. Too bad I foiled it.I guess he only knows how to block people without reading a single word of what people write or even understanding the issue. I sympathize with his condition.Some people do get obsessed and have control issues with wiki I guess, Vesther being a case in point.Is it possible that this guys a friend or a sock-puppet of an earlier aggrieved cabal member? LOL.Anyway, the above two examples are on record, and you are the witness!!! And I hope next time you act strongly and correctively on such issues, I mean un-blocking.I guess this petty cabal must have been going about this, just block, without any warning to block, and without understanding or reading anything about it, with other people, before they came across someone like me, LOL. And after that they try and make excuses and dig up old irrelevant issues which they couldnt muster up before that, as excuses. They must be quite experienced in trying to obfuscate the SPECIFIC ISSUE IN QUESTION later on. LOL.I sincerely think that you should have exercised your right to unblock, seeing how u understood the issue, and the concerned admin or admins had no expanation for the block.No reading, no understanding of the specific issue, no warning to the original guilty party, no warning to block, just block!!!! LOL.But Now, they will think hard before going on about their murky ways.LOL.So, by extrapolating this, I have come to the conclusion that wiki is seriously and morally challenged and also lacks in competence. LOL.All the more reason its needs me. LOL.I wont let you down wiki. LOL.Of course, there must be many good decent admins like you.A few words about my messages I had sent.With regard to Vesther, we both know what I feel about him. HAHAHAHAHA.

LOL.Vesther just couldnt take it I guess after I repied back, giving him some of his own medicine, he just started crying. LOL. I guess he's not used to it. Maybe till now people just got bored of his obsessive ways and ignored him. LOL. Too bad. I see he has been receiving some much needed counselling from his best friend Crossmr who Did Not give him a warning for the very same words.

By the way, the circumcision in front of the grass hut on pa of the WHO pamphlet, \"\"Global Trends,\"\" would indicate that the purported HIV protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions.  Would that also target the English-speaking readers of a wiki site like Wikipedia?  ...  Anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the Gilgal Fellows  perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work.    Unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest.  I have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world African HIV studies on our modern audience to no avail.    Thanks for the link to a conflict of interest. Since there are a number of fellows who edit this article, it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the Gilgal Fellows described here  It could be revelatory for Circumcision Wikipedia to include a section on the Gilgal Fellows, who apparently have quite a mission.  It\\'s my understanding that GILGAL is an obscure word for MOUNTAIN OF BURNING FORESKINS.     No one having objected to the proposed sections on Circumcision Fetish and the Gilgal Fellows, I will assume a consensus, delegate the research, and get back here with it ASAP.

Perhaps it\\'s a little presumptuous, but it\\'s realistic.  It\\'s usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change; take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself.As for your proposals, previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a \"\"circumcision fetish\"\"; searching Google Scholar for \"\"Gilgal Society\"\" indicates that there are no reliable, secondary sources regarding that subject either.

He agrees with my addition.I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.Advantages of MWIIf Hugh Everett\\'s theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper\\'s criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, \"\"God does not play dice with the universe.\"\"2. It eliminates the \"\"measurement problem.\"\"3. It eliminates Von Neumann\\'s \"\"boundary problem\"\": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death 953, Albert Einstein wrote: \"\"Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.\"\"4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: \"\"Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\"\"6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, \"\"[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery.\"\" David Deutcsh wrote: \"\". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment.\"\"7. Schrodinger\\'s Cat paradox evaporates.It seems Einstein\\'s main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking\\'s No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark\\'s All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle. \"',\n",

Instead, it depicted itself as a citizens group merely interested in American ideals of freedom. Rather than argue the policy nuances of entitlement programs or new regulations, the Birch Society marshaled opposition by depicting progressive reform as capitulation to the Soviet Union. In that polarized environment, the interests of millionaires suddenly became aligned with patriotic families who wanted to do their part against the communist threat.Shortly after the Birch Society faded, David Koch founded Americans for Prosperity 984 (then known as Citizens for a Sound Economy).\"\" author=Berkowitz, Bill | location=Oakland, CA}} \"\"He was introduced to conservative politics by his father, a member of the advisory council of the fiercely anti-communist John Birch Society .

       " '\"::::::::: Use or indeed overuse of the words \\'informer\\' or \\'suspected informer\\' alone remains pejorative and inappropriate here. Angus\\'s suggestion of \"\"suspected by the IRA of being an informer\\' is not unreasonable as it indicates that it is a concept or crime particular to that side of the dispute. Sarah argues, \"\"What they are commonly called is what we should reflect here. Any inhabitant of Ireland who assisted with information given to the British was an informer.\"\" She avoids my earlier point. \\'Commonly\\' has to include, in Ireland, Protestants and Unionists (who were themselves British) and therefore the concept is not common currency unless you regard Protestants as people of no consequence at all in the matter. Can you inform yourself?And was it in \\'common\\' use in Ireland that you would call someone who had reported a rape or a stray cow an informer? Sarah\\'s other point that \"\"Protestants who openly supported the Republic were never killed. So it wasn\\'t a sectarian matter\"\" is risible. As if you execute those who come across to your side? Anyway most Protestant Republicans became Catholics.

If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   I get that.

(tal, Apr (UTC)Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Eliz3\\'s comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis.

BTW, I\\'m French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome\\'s first daughter.   we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth.

The reality is that we are more like soda pop in a bottle, where we have a certain amount of nitrogen, oxygen, and other trace gasses dissolved in our bloodstream at STP. The key here is the STP part. As with a bottle of soda, when the pressure is decreased, the gasses rapidly come out of solution, which is what produces the fizz. Similarly, if your body went rapidly from STP to the vacuum of outer space, you would almost certainly experience a similar effect. To be blunt, your blood would quite literally boil and you would surly die of an aneurysm or internal bleeding from all the vessels which would be breached by the gasses trying to escape. About the closest I've seen to this being accurately portrayed is in the film Event Horizon, where it shows all the vessels on Justin's body becoming visible as they rapidly expand when the airlock pressure is decreased. But still, it does not explain where the gas goes, which is the same problem in this film. It seems wholly impossible to survive such a drastic change in atmospheric pressure.\",\n",

       " \"Not so. The Highland Scots spoke Gaelic. The historic common language of the Lowands however was Northern English - from tth century onwards brought by the Anglo-Saxons who arrived in Caledonia at almost exactly the same time as the Scots. It continued to be called English (often spelled Inglis and other variants) until the very end of t5th century when some Scots, correctly or incorrectly,  began calling their northern variant(s) of English 'Scots'. They had previously called Gaelic 'Scots'. Scots-English (in addition to Scots) was certainly commonplace by the Act of Union 707 - and indeed was already commonplace by the time of the King James bible 611. Historic spelling sometimes gives a quite false impression of difference, but there was no real standard spelling anywhere in Britain, in England or Scotland, until t8th century.  Today some believe that Scots was and is a different language from English, others that Scots is simply the collective name for the historic variants of English found in Scotland.\",\n",

Though I certainly understand what the author was thinking, not everything considered \"\"pornographic\"\" by everyone\\'s standards is necessarily \"\"hyperreal.\"\"  Without delving into the differing definitions of pornography, there\\'s a specific example I can think of which illustrates my argument.  Let\\'s say someone makes an amateur video of him or herself having intercourse, and let\\'s postulate that this person decides to sell said video for whatever reason.  Since it\\'s a depiction of a sex act and it\\'s being distributed, this video would be considered pornographic by most definitions.  Nothing about it, however, is inherently hyperreal.  Someone might be interested in purchasing it for the purpose of sexual arousal, and I acknowledge that being aroused by a digital representation is clearly a \"\"hyperreal\"\" act, but that doesn\\'t make this piece of pornography hyperreal in and of itself.  This might be an odd example, but I think it serves to illustrate that \"\"pornography\"\" is too vague and subjective a concept to consider inherently hyperreal.

It is true (this is also said above) that the majority of links which went to The Nation (disambiguation) were meant to go to The Nation (U.S. periodical).  However, I found that in all the cases where this was not true (e.g. when the Irish or Thai periodical was meant) the editors of those articles seemed to not be aware of the U.S. periodical.  (This makes sense, incidentally, as this periodical is not entirely well known even in the U.S.)  In short, the old situation was that there were a ton of links to a disambiguation page, which is to be avoided, but in this new situation, I think we'll eventually see a ton of links to simply the wrong thing, which strikes me as worse.Moreover, a remark:  although the majority of the inbound links were meant for the U.S. periodical, I think there is a systemic bias at work here.  A vast majority of those were in bibliographies, where a web article from The Nation was referenced.  Many (almost all?) sources in Wikipedia bibliographies are web-based, and thus we should not be surprised to see a current magazine overrepresented, especially when constrasted with9th century publication.

This is the comments from Lead Your writing has a lot of adverbs like \"\"originally\"\" \"\"primarily\"\" \"\"mainly\"\", these aren\\'t necessary.  Sometimes they have a place but they also clutter up the prose and many of them can be removed. Third cable channel behind disney and nick.  Third in what?  Kids\\' programming?  It\\'s not clear. Overall in the lead the writing is choppy and needs to be streamlined.  Here\\'s an example:\"\"Sin009, it began airing a small amount of live-action programming, specifically movies from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema, both of which are also owned by Time Warner.\"\"  Rewrite like this, \"\"009 it started airing live-action programming, including movies from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema.\"\"  No one cares that they\\'re owned by Time Warner. See WP:LEAD for instructions on what should be in a good lead.  The lead should be a summary of the entire article and this lead should be enhanced to include every subject within the article (written in a summary style).History The clean up banner is legitimate and should be addressed.  Usually clean up banners should be handled before the article is listed at WP:PR.  I can see a number of  templates in the following sections.  These should be addressed and the sourcing improved. As a general rule every paragraph should have at least one source, and more if there are multiple assertions. See WP:INCITE for reference anchor placement.  They don\\'t go in the middle of the sentence but rather at the end unless the assertion is very controversial. The parenthetical reference in the first sentence is too detailed.  Give a few examples of what was acquired and leave it at that. Watch out for one sentence paragraphs.  These stubs are not acceptable at GAC.  Consider combining or expanding. Make sure titles are always italicized even when not linked. What is meant by the \"\"Powerhouse era\"\"?  What is powerhouse music?  Programming This is a section with no prose.  Not good.  Sections with just a tophat are unnecessary.  Either add some prose or remove the section.  I think you fold in most of the programming info in the previous section.Related projects Here is a section \"\"Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall\"\" see above.References The key to references is consistency.  Make sure every website ref has at least the title, url, publisher, and accessdate. You probably want to use templates like  to help with consistency. Deviantart appears to be a blog or discussion forum.  This is not a credible reference.  See WP:CITE and WP:VERIFY for instructions on credible references.  Avoid blogs, forums, chat rooms, social networking sites etc.Overall As stated above the article needs a lot more referencing.  This will be a major sticking point if you want it to pass GAC.  * I would also seek out someone who can do a thorough copy edit. There isn\\'t much about the financing of the channel, advertising revenue, demographics that sort of thing.  It would be nice to see some more information on these topics. This concludes my review.  Please contact me on my talk page if you have specific questions.  Best of luck to you.I\\'ve fix the issue. Some movies were carried fr0th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures which are not owned by Time Warner. I\\'ve improved some  it a little bit, but the article needs to be rewrite and remove any blog, user and fan sites which are not reliable. Any reliable sources can be added per WP:V and WP:RS. Remember,  is recommended. Good luck improving the article.  (Talk / Contributions) \"',\n",

I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People\\'s Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me.

If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.Peter has also set up the \"\"Australian Worker\\'s Party\"\"Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it\\'s name to NCPA than change it\\'s name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP.

It used to be thought that redirects were bad, and we should avoid them, trying as hard as we can to replace them with the precise name. Then it was discovered that Google found things easier through redirects, and they provided a way for us refine Google\\'s search semantics quite a bit. So it helps people find what they want, and avoids the problems of having to be too precise about linkages. Its more of a wiki way to do it. Not to mention that this type of linkage comes from our disambig policy, to use disambig pages liberally, but always be hierarchical according to common sense. More recently it was discovered that tools to \"\"fix\"\" redirects (like the one in WP:POP) are hugely taxing on the server, so that ended the last of the purists crying about link precision. The funny thing is that link precision is actually a hindance to semantic searching. So, over the years the idea has been to make WP redirects function as a part of the semantic web.

There is no reason even to bring up the mathematically complicated natural/free convection when forced convection (the common type that happens in car radiators) works just as well as illustration. Choaygame is technically and perfectly correct that only internal energy (not heat) can be advected as a bulk flow of matter containing energy within it and moved from here to there. That means heat pumps don\\'t really pump heat but rather energy. Heat cannot because heat cannot be stored in matter since the amount of it there, cannot even be defined! If you can\\'t put a number on it you can\\'t claim it\\'s \"\"real \"\".Temperature and thus kinetic energy may  play only minor roles in this, when energy of phase transitions is involved. For example water can be turned to steam and sent down a pipe to transfer energy by condensing somewhere else, and yet the temp changes are very small as small as you like for a given transfer. They are markets for direction of transfer but cannot be used to quantitate how much energy is moved. That\\'s a clue that they aren\\'t fundamental and are in no way the core of what is happening physically. Physically it is potential energy being moved, not unlike moving a charged battery from here to there. It actually has nothing to do with \"\"heat\"\" in a thermodynamic sens\"',\n",
       " '\"Please consult the article Ball culture, which states \"\"drag queen, or transgendered\"\". WP:OR does not cover synthesis by bringing two facts together.  As well, the term \"\"Femme queen\"\" does not have an article, so the term is currently of dubious usage as it\\'s a neologism, (which WP policy suggests to avoid using).  You state a source: \"\"TGMSMNET\"\", however neither this page, nor the mainpage refer to such a reference.  From the way you talked about it, I linked it to the \"\"MSTSW\"\" reference.  In the future, if you could, could you please site resources on this page by using this form? [http://example.com http://example.com] That way it shows up like this http://www.example.com, and one can simply click on the resource, rather than search through the article for the reference itself.  Your data is backed up there as well.  However, we still have issue... how would the CDC consider a post-op MTF living in stealth as anything else but a \"\"female\"\"... the MTF would obviously not admit to being a transsexual, and in fact engages in no activity any more risky than a \"\"biological\"\" female.  (I wait for further evidence that TG/TS is caused by biological factors, and thus the term \"\"biological male/female\"\" becomes complicated in even research... no one would ever state that a woman with CAIS is \"\"biologically\"\" a male...)  As well, I understand the point of not using WP as a soap box... however in talk pages, I\\'m still free to assert the better application and appropriate nature of the term \"\"people having URAP\"\"...   \"',\n",
