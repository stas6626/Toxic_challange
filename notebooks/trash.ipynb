After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't Hüttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known?

Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

You have these rules to prevent harassment. Fine. I was just doing it for fun, got it out of my system, I'll quit now. However, you should seriously consider a NDB&LP; rule, or No Dumb Bastards and Lazy People. Wikipedia is currently a laughing stock, a punchline to a joke. The reason is that it facilitates lazy people like Tao. If you read the entire entry, my intention is to improve the page. I provide sources, I provide a sound argument, I provide what's necessary to provide in circumstances like this in order to improve the page. What does Tao provide? Nothing. He clearly has not read the page, he clearly does not know the subject, and he clearly is uninterested in doing what needs to   \n",

He is also seeing a fusion of Kach and Neturei Karta, since 'both oppose the state'. I tried to clarify it, giving some examples of the thought of NK and Kach (without naming either), and what is his conclusion - 'the press releases of the Sanhedrin so far are more like NK'. Please, please, try to explain to him that I am right. How do you explain Jewish politics to somebody with the brain of a fish??  | (talk)   \n",

Area is easy to define: It is the product of two averages. Volume is not 'analogous' to area - whoever wrote this, needs to look up the word analogous. Volume is defined as the product of three averages. It is also accurate to say that area has no extent - just like a point or line. Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?\\n\\nb. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. \\n\\nc. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.\\n\\nd. The FACT is a major computer site    \n",

Many Jews, who documentally were stated as Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, esc. were of Jewish origin, just mentioned in docs as Slavics to escape Soviet-anti-Semitic persecutions... Real Russian people were killed only as \"\"rivals\"\", because of _war_ and not the _holocaust_!\\n\\nP.S. For homosexuals killing, mentioned above - I would have killed them all if had a chance! Really, killing homosexuals is not a sin, according to Bible. AND, homosexuality was widely spread in 20'th century Germany, so i doubt they were really persecuted... Hitler stated himself that that were Jews', who dont'let Germany win the First War, and all other casaulties were mostly accidental... And, of course Soviets, who protected their counry agai   \n",

Since Kurds are heterogeneous people, I used that statement. You need to read what I wrote thoroughly. Wikipedia is such full of crap, I gave many links to my statement on  Joshs page. I know what I am writing is facts. I did what you asked by writing in this talk page. Wikipedia even refers to the Kurdish language as language(s)which does not even make any sense. I am a Kurd myself, I know what I am talking about. Please give me at least 2 reliable sources that refers to the Kurdish language as language(s).

Malleus simply cannot resist taking any opportunity to belittle people. And yet when we respond or make the mistake of telling the fucking truth, we get punished (and seriously, don't bother giving me any claptrap bullshit about blocks being preventive; they're punitive and you know it, otherwise unblocks would be swift and frequent).

You are wrong about \"\"can't take it back\"\", since any self-revert does just that, and self-reverts are permitted, Mr. Mann jess. Again, it is just a matter of opinion whether my edits were improvements or disimprovements. It isn't an objective thing as you portend to assert. I don't have any \"\"feud\"\" with you, Mann jess.

Shame on you Jerskine and Citizen Dick for being cold emotionless MONSTERS! You should do research and see that the Christian made the ultimate sacrifice along with 343 other firefighters in trying to save lives. His death launched a national organization and movement and made his mother Sally the accidential activist. Her work will prevent other mothers from suffering the pain that she will have to live with for the rest of her life.
